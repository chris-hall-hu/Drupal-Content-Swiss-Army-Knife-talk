					  <h2>Backstory</h2>
					  <p>
						  Prior to Drupal, I had already worked with a variety of technologies and frameworks, going back into the mists of time, Cold Fusion, Perl, Java based etc.</p>
					  </p>
					  <ul>
					    <li>Had been using Drupal for a few years in a number of different agencies and environments some times with mixed results, also had some exposure work with Django a Python framework</li>
					    <li>Found myself in a situation with highly pragmatic, shifting requirements and need to procees content (both existing and new) from many sources to many places</li>
					    <li>There were already existing/commissioned sites implemented in Wordpress, ExpressionEngine Drupal 7, Drupal 6....</li>
					    <li>Many content workflows, legacy sites, some based on Word Docs, email and spreadsheets</li>
				    </ul>
				  </section>
					<section>
						<h2>Mixed results in the past</h2>
						<p>Experience of Drupal not <em>always</em> good, in some projects and situations Drupal worked well, in others not!
						I have been using Drupal for longer than my three years on Drupal.org, it started as a tool, then became <em>everything</em>. My first involvement with Django was joining a project that somebody had saved from a Drupal disaster by starting from scratch.
						The project was about data-processing and a normal Drupal approach did not work (happy to discuss over a beer). Many Drupal project have gone well however.
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>A new challenging environment</h2>
						<ul>
						  <li>Shifting requirements/priorities</li>
						  <li>Tight time-scales and budgets</li>
							<li>Legacy and new sites</li>
							<li>A small development team (me most of the time)</li>
					  </ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Should I even be using Drupal?</h2>
						<p>As an early part of the work I had to do involved taking over and finishing an ExpressionEngine site and there were existing Worpress sites as well as Drupal, I even had to ask whether I should be using Drupal at all going forward.
						   Especially as I felt I was becoming a Drupal only developer and that didn't feel entirely healthly.
						</p>
						<p>
							Actually some of these issues I had already seen in previous work.
						</p>
				  </section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
					  <h2>Drupal: what is it good for?</h2>
						<p>Not everything surprisingly (can I say that here?)</p>
					  <blockquote>"With Drupal typically the first 90% of a project takes a week, the remaining 10% can take anything from a week to 3 months" (me)</blockquote>
						<blockquote>"With Drupal features are cheap and details expensive" (WunderKraut)</blockquote>
				  </section>
					<section>
            <h2>Design first approach can really crash and burn with Drupal</h2>
						<p>WunderKraut blog <a href="http://www.wunderkraut.com/blog/how-to-fail-in-a-drupal-project-fixed-price-contracts/2013-07-10">How to fail in a Drupal project: Fixed price contracts</a>
						says most of what I feel after years of Drupal. If someone hands you a beautiful PSD designed project and says make it so,
						you really may be better off with a more light-weight framework. (no-body gonna drag me off the stage...?)</p>
						<small>There are too many things for things for this talk so I will link out but don't worry all the links are on a <a href="">slide at the end :)</a></small>
					</section>
					<section>
            <h2>Through the Lens of Drupal 8</h2>
						<p>Jumping forward to the <em>imminent</em> release of Drupal 8 to look back on Drupal 7</p>
						<p>The key difference should be to make it easier to find Drupal talent, currently Drupal has a long learning curve, even more worryingly even experienced Drupal developers
							 may be taking different 'correct' but incompatible approaches (Panels, Context, etc. etc.) D8 will resuse some existing frameworks and more mainstream PHP design practices.
            <blockquote>An agile tool should not require an extensive learning curve before it becomes useful.</blockquote>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Other improvements expected from D8</h2>
						<p>Some of the biggest current weaknesses of Drupal are to addressed</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Improved experience for admins and site builders</li>
							<li>More useful out of the box (which helps with the above)</li>
							<li>Better separation of configuration from code and data</li>
							<li>Improved templating (although I suspect still behind some alternatiives)</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>The biggest strength remains: Content</h2>
						Often Drupal is described as a Content Management Framework(CMF) rather than a Content Management System(CMS).
						I have to agree with this Palantir Blog <a href="http://www.palantir.net/blog/drupal-not-cms">Drupal is not a CMS</a>.
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Notes</h2>
						<p>I have encountered too many designers/frontenders who attempted to use Drupal to extend their repetoire, crashed and turned to Wordpress or similar.</p>
					  <p>I have encountered too many agencies moving from Design to full service and crashing with Drupal, turning to Wordpress or ExpressionEngine or Modx ....</p>
						<p>Note: I have not really talked about the Drupal community, when looking to use a tool you shouldn't expect to have to join a <em>'support group'</em>,
							community support and the inertia to pull in the contrib. modules will be vital to D8 success though I think.</p>
