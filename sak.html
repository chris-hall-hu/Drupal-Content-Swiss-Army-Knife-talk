					  <h2>Backstory</h2>
					  <p>
						  Prior to Drupal, I had already worked with a variety of technologies and frameworks, going back into the mists of time, Cold Fusion, Perl, Java based etc.</p>
					  </p>
					  <ul>
					    <li>Had been using Drupal for a few years in a number of different agencies and environments sometimes with mixed results, also had some exposure to Django a Python framework</li>
					    <li>Found myself in a situation with highly pragmatic, shifting requirements and need to procees content (both existing and new) from many sources to many places</li>
					    <li>There were already existing/commissioned sites implemented in Wordpress, ExpressionEngine, Drupal 7, Drupal 6....</li>
					    <li>Many content workflows, legacy sites, some based on Word docs, email and spreadsheets</li>
				    </ul>
				  </section>
					<section>
						<h2>Drupal has not always turned out well</h2>
						<p>Previous experience of Drupal not <em>always</em> good, in some projects and situations Drupal worked well, in others not!
						I have been using Drupal for longer than my three years on Drupal.org, it started as a tool, then became <em>everything</em>. My first involvement with Django was joining a project that somebody had saved from a Drupal disaster by starting from scratch.
						The project was about data-processing and a normal Drupal approach did not work (happy to discuss over a beer). Many Drupal projects have gone well however.
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Suddenly in new challenging environment</h2>
						<ul>
						  <li>Shifting requirements/priorities</li>
						  <li>Tight time-scales and budgets</li>
							<li>Legacy and new sites</li>
							<li>A wide variety of content sources and types ranging from age WYSIWYG content to highly structure xml.</li>
							<li>A small development team (me most of the time)</li>
					  </ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Should I even be using Drupal?</h2>
						<p>As an early part of the work I had to do involved taking over and finishing an ExpressionEngine site and there were existing Wordpress sites as well as Drupal, I even had to ask whether I should be using Drupal at all going forward.
						   Especially as I felt I was becoming a Drupal only developer and that didn't feel entirely healthly.
						</p>
						<p>
							Actually some of these issues I had already seen in previous work.
						</p>
				  </section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
					  <h2>Drupal: what is it good for?</h2>
						<p>Not everything surprisingly (can I say that here?)</p>
					  <blockquote>"With Drupal typically the first 90% of a project takes a week, the remaining 10% can take anything from a week to 3 months" (me)</blockquote>
						<blockquote>"With Drupal features are cheap and details expensive" (WunderKraut)</blockquote>
				  </section>
					<section>
            <h2>Design first approach can really suck with Drupal</h2>
						<p>This WunderKraut blog <a href="http://www.wunderkraut.com/blog/how-to-fail-in-a-drupal-project-fixed-price-contracts/2013-07-10">How to fail in a Drupal project: Fixed price contracts</a>
						says most of what I feel after years of Drupal. If someone hands you a beautiful PSD designed project and says make it so,
						you really may be better off with a more light-weight framework. (nobody going to drag me off the stage...?)</p>
						<small>There are many linkouts for this talk, but don't worry all the links are on a <a href="">slide at the end :)</a></small>
					</section>
					<section>
            <h2>Looking back through the lens of Drupal 8</h2>
						<p>Jumping forward to the <em>imminent</em> release of Drupal 8 to look back on Drupal 7</p>
						<p>The key difference should be to make it easier to find Drupal talent, currently Drupal has a long learning curve, even more worryingly even experienced Drupal developers
							 may be taking different 'correct' but incompatible approaches (Panels, Context, etc. etc.) D8 will use some existing frameworks and more mainstream PHP design practices.
            <blockquote>An agile tool should not require an extensive learning curve before it becomes useful.</blockquote>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Other improvements expected from D8</h2>
						<p>Some of the biggest current weaknesses of Drupal are to be addressed</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Improved experience for admins and site builders</li>
							<li>More useful out of the box (which helps with the above)</li>
							<li>Better separation of configuration from code and data</li>
							<li>Improved templating (although I suspect still behind some alternatiives)</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>The main strength remains: Content</h2>
						Often Drupal is described as a Content Management Framework(CMF) rather than a Content Management System(CMS).
						I have to agree with this Palantir Blog <a href="http://www.palantir.net/blog/drupal-not-cms">Drupal is not a CMS</a>.
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Notes</h2>
						<p>Although it my seem harsh to say that Drupal is hard to learn, particularly for someone who is already an <em>insider</em>, I have encountered too many designers/frontenders who attempted to use Drupal to extend their repetoire, crashed and turned to Wordpress or similar, I have encountered too many agencies moving from Design to full service and crashing with Drupal, turning to Wordpress or ExpressionEngine or Modx ....</p>
						<p>Note: I have not really talked about the Drupal community (which is a marvellous thing in it's own right) but when looking to use a tool you shouldn't expect to <em>have</em> to join a <em>'support group'</em>,
							community support and the inertia to pull in the contrib. modules will be vital to D8 success though I think.</p>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
					  <h2>Before we write any PHP</h2>
						<p>Some of the things we can do very easily to start building our own content management system.</p>
					  <p>
						  Drupal has the most comprehensive administrative functionality for modelling content of any of the frameworks/tools I have used.
					  </p>
					  <p>
					    The screen below is from Drupal 8, note that Drupal 8 improves things for the non-developer because a few more fields like email, date and entity reference are included in Core.
					  </p>
				  </section>
					<section data-background="images/fields.png">
						  <h2 class="shadow fragment">So many possibilities</h2>
					</section>
				  <section>
						  <h2>Even the fields are highly configurable</h2>
							<p>Content fields can have lots of options </p>
							<ul>
								<li>Default values</li>
								<li>Help text</li>
								<li>Number of values</li>
								<li>Validation settings</li>
								<li>Appropriate meta data</li>
							</ul>
					</section>

						<h2>Content workflow</h2>
						<p>Without lifting a finger we have user management, revisioning, roles and permissions.</p>
						<p>Add a couple of modules such as <a href="#">Diff</a> and <a href="#">Workbench</a>, already we are building a powerful content system.
					  <p>Workbench allows us to add stages and users to a custom editorial workflow, diff is a nice little addition that allows users who can see revisions to visualise changes between them.</p>
					</section>
					<section data-background="images/revs.png">
						<h2 class="shadow fragment">Now I know who did what and when</h2>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>Content classification</h2>
						<p>The ease with which you can apply multiple taxononomies in Drupal and the tools surrounding them are not often found elsewhere.</p>
					  <p>Although sometimes a little help from a module such as <a href="#">Taxonomy Manager</a> can help to organise them.
					</section>
					<section data-background="images/tax.png">
            <h2 class="shadow fragment">Much better than the standard admin</h2>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>Content search and discovery</h2>
						<p>Once we build a large volume of content we have use of the powerful <a href="#">Views</a> module help filter and sort.
						</p>I am confident that everybody will be familiar with views, more on the subject later
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Search API</h2>
				    <p>The search that comes out of the box with Drupal is not too horrible, it will be vastly enchanced however by adding the <a href="#">Search Api</a> and <a href="#">Facet API module</a>
						<blockquote>Search API can vastly enchance search even without the addition of Apache Solr</blockquote>
				  </section>
					<section data-background="images/facet.png">
						<h2 class="shadow fragment">You don't need Apache Solr to start building a powerfull search</h2>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Notes</h2>
						<p>Search API and the various modules that work with it can be used to build powerful searches even without the aid a Apache Solr,
							although not as performant this may suffice if traffic is moderate and will certainly suffice for testing and development.
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					<section>
						<h2>Pause to reflect</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>We can do a lot (and so much more), without touching PHP</li>
								<li>Drupal 8 (assuming a handful of contrib modules) can do it better, inline editing for example</li>
								<li>This is FAST, the slow bits are trying to match those design PSDs to build a frontend.</li>
							</ul>
							<p>We can do better though...</p>
					</section>
					<section>
							<h2>Improving the backend</h2>
							<p>Jeni Tehan has an excellent talk on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=53s0njgpc7U">Building a Tasty Backend</a>
								that suggests how to significantly improve the content authoring experience using available modules and techniques.</p>
					</section>
				</section>

				<section>
					 <section>
					   <h2>Usecase 1, replacing a Spreadsheet with Drupal</h2>
						 <p>You may even reduce the amount of evilness in the world ;)</p>
						 <p>I have encountered more than one case of content being collated, gathered and edited in Excel spreadsheets prior to website developement.</p>
						 <p>One agency that was going to build a cheap Wordpress website for a friend of mine even advised setting up a spreadsheet to prepare his content (he was putting all the data from one catalog entry into a single cell).</p>
						 <p>How quickly could you set up a simple Drupal site for data-entry on a $5-$10 VPS? (the answer is very easy of course)</p>
					 </section>
					 <section>
						 <ul>
							  <li>The content can be searched, sorted</li>
							  <li>The content can be viewed/previewed on line</li>
							  <li>Media can be added if required</li>
							  <li>Proper categorisation can be set up</li>
							  <li>Most of the work is done by the client</li>
								<li>IA etc. can to some extent develop iteratively</li>
						 </ul>
						 <p>Getting the content out comes later.....</p>
						 <p>Or maybe build a theme on top of it, the content could inform your Design/UX/UI process (sorry Wordpress, but we will get back to you later.)</p>

					  <h2>Starting to add PHP</h2>
						  <p>
							  Developers have all the admin tools that non-developers have but they have opportunities to write code.
							</p>
						  <p>
                A developer writes PHP somewhere, Drupal provided hooks etc. I like to think of Drupal without custom code as a <em>'Ready Meal'</em>
							</p>
					</section>
					<section data-background="images/rmeal.jpg">
						  <h2 class="shadow fragment">This is not cooking</h2>
							<h2 class="shadow fragment">Even though it may be fit for purpose</h2>
					</section>
					<section>
						  <h2>Client admin -> Drupal Sitebuilder</h2>
							<p>Why do I often sense resistence to this level of training?</p>
							<p class="fragment">Perhaps because then they will realise there is hardly any custom code in many sites :P</p>
							<p class="fragment">Actually most of the custom code on many sites is CSS, HTML and JS.</p>
					</section>

					  <h2>To the command line and Drush</h2>
					  <p>
						  The command line seems to be stonger than ever, perhaps because OSX has a decent one, because Designers and Frontend developers are setting up Ruby and CSS pre-processors plus other workflow tools.
					  </p>
					  <p>
						  I am assuming that most people don't need need to be introduced to <a href="https://github.com/drush-ops/drush">Drush</a> a PHP command line tool that has many commands for Drupal</a>
              aside from the standard module downloading, installing disabling etc.. Many contrib modules (Features and Migrate for example) provide Drush commands that are often easier/faster to run than via the normal admin interface.
            </p>
				  </section>

				  <section>
					  <h2>Drush can save time</h2>
					  <p>Create a quick backup in your home directory:</p>
					  <pre><code data-trim contenteditable>
$ drush sql-dump > ~/backup.sql
					  </code></pre>
					  <p>Load a quick backup:</p>
            <pre><code data-trim contenteditable>
$ drush sqlc < ~/backup.sql
            </code></pre>
						<p>You can script the Drush commands with a shell script if you wish</p>
					  <p>Note: a dev tool, not a replacement for Backup and Migrate module or server backups</p>
          </section>

					<section>
						<h2>Drush can bootstrap Drupal</h2>
						<p>Create a php file and run it from the command line against Drupal using Drush.</p>
<pre><code data-trim contenteditable>
$ drush scr foo.php
</code></pre>
						<p>This will load a node and spit out on the command line</p>
<pre><code data-trim contenteditable>

$node = node_load(100);

print_r($node);
</code></pre>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Bootstrapped Drupal can do so much more</h2>
						<p>Load some nodes and iterate over them:</p>
<pre><code data-trim contenteditable>

// Note: this is rubbish deprecated slow ass way to load nodes.
$nodes = node_load_multiple(array(), array('type' => 'production_content'));

// Iterate over the nodes and reprocess them.
foreach ($nodes as $node) {

  // Do something with each $node you evil genius you.
  node_save($node); //muhahahaaaaaa
}

</code></pre>
<p>You can make this as complicated as you like, refine the selection process, etc. improve the code.
					</section>
				  <section>
						<h2>Drush works with Drupal 8 :)</h2>
						<p>You can use Drush to experiment quickly with D8 code.</p>
						<p>D8 also works with Composer the PHP package manager (I believe you can now use composer to manage libraries in your modules)</p>
						<p>There is also the <a href="#">Drupal 8</a> console code that is growing all the time, basically <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rk4enIuhWno#t=2822">watch this video</a> and be amazed :):)
						This will generate all the boilerplate code for modules, service, routes, plugins, blocks etc. for you on request.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>Use Views Bulk Operations you!</h2>
						<p>Yes if you don't code PHP or want to set something up for somebody you can do some neat stuff with <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/views_bulk_operations">Views Bulk Operations</a>
						<p>There is so much more you can do with code though.....
						  <ul>
							  <li>you can get the rendered page for a path</li>
						    <li>with a little helper code in a module you can even use <a href="https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/modules%21system%21system.api.php/function/hook_module_implements_alter/7">hook_module_implements_alter()</a> to monkey around with hook implementations in special circumstances</li>
								<li>or just about anything you can think of with the data in Drupal</li>
					    </ul>
						<p>If you are a developer and nothing springs to mind at this point then ......</p>

					  <h2>Querypath (to fix stinky HTML)</h2>
					  <p><img src="images/wig.png"> WYSIWYG the epitome of evil!</p>
					  <p><a href="http://querypath.org/">Querypath</a> is a PHP library that allows you to load in HTML and XML documents and work with them in a similar manner to JQuery.
					  There is even a Drupal <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/querypath">Querypath module</a> that makes things a bit easier to make the library accessible to your code.</p>
			    </section>
				  <section>
							<h2>Querypath is very powerful</h2>
							<p>You can in theory correct/adjust just about any html in a field, and fix most of the atrocities caused by hand edited html or WYSIWYG editors (because some people are going to just try to put an html page into your body field).</p>
		<pre><code>
$content_body = '<html><head><meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8"></head><body>' . $content_body . '</body></html>';

$qp_options = array(
	'convert_to_encoding' => 'utf-8',
	'convert_from_encoding' => 'utf-8',
	'strip_low_ascii' => FALSE,
);

$qp = htmlqp($content_body, NULL, $qp_options);
$imgs = $qp->top('img');

foreach ($imgs as $img) {
	$img->remove();
}
$node->body[LANGUAGE_NONE][0]['value'] = $qp->top('body')->innerHTML();
</code></pre>
				  </section>
					<section>
					   <h2>Try doing that with VBO</h2>
						 <p>You can do more complicated things such a removing old-school named anchors and placing their anchors as
							ids on their parent element (just an example), the sky is the limit really.</p>
						 <p>And of course you can manipulate the html (or XML) anywhere you write code, not just in some crazy script</p>

				<h2>Things I haven't had to address (yet)</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Multi-lingual content, Drupal 7 is pretty good at this already although it appears that Drupal 8 will raise this a couple more notches</li>
					<li>Push notifications (will need to start thinking about this when for performance reasons at some point.)</li>
			</section>
